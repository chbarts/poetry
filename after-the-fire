After The Fire

After the fire
the trees come back.
The naked land becomes messy again
as life bends and flexes and remembers its place.
The dead ash washes away like a bad taste replaced by clean water.
The firebreak scars and the suffocating chemicals erode under the onslaught of life's gentle persistence.
Life knits together anew, forgetting mindless, rampant, descructive feeding, erasing the treason of boundless greed.
Only the people, awed by life's unstoppable contagion, remember a forest as old as time growing from tender, green shoots.
